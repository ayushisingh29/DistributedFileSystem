/** RMI skeleton

    <p>
    A skeleton encapsulates a multithreaded TCP server. The server's clients are
    intended to be RMI stubs created using the <code>Stub</code> class.

    <p>
    The skeleton class is parametrized by a type variable. This type variable
    should be instantiated with an interface. The skeleton will accept from the
    stub requests for calls to the methods of this interface. It will then
    forward those requests to an object. The object is specified when the
    skeleton is constructed, and must implement the remote interface. Each
    method in the interface should be marked as throwing
    <code>RMIException</code>, in addition to any other exceptions that the user
    desires.

    <p>
    Exceptions may occur at the top level in the listening and service threads.
    The skeleton's response to these exceptions can be customized by deriving
    a class from <code>Skeleton</code> and overriding <code>listen_error</code>
    or <code>service_error</code>.
